Pathtracing for Dummies | 2 | 2023-11-08 | cg

I've been writing a pathtracer for a couple months now. It started out as a raytracer in Python but when that grew too slow I moved to C++ and incrementally turned it into a pathtracer that can render convex polygon meshes.

I want to explain how pathtracing works and how it fits into the broad term "raytracing." When I first look into all this I got quite confused at all the different terminology and scary looking integrals.
