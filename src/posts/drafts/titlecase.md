Capitalizing Titles | 4 | 2023-09-30 | math,algorithm,python

I use [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/) to capitalize titles or to check that I've done it correctly. I wanted a local solution though, in case the Internet goes out or something. Besides, it's trivial to do this in Python. Although Python has a builtin `"string".title()` function, it sucks. It isn't smart enough to not captialize articles or coordinate conjunctionsâ€”it doesn't captialize hyphenated words correctly either.

There are different rules depending on the style guide you choose to abide by, but most of them require you to lowercase 

```py
import nltk

# builtin str.title() capitalizes letter after single quotes.
def upper_(s):
    # to account for words starting with starting quotes.
    if s[0] in {"'", '"'}:
        return s[0] + s[1].upper() + s[2:]
    return s[0].upper() + s[1:]

title = nltk.pos_tag(input().split())
for i in range(len(title)):
    word, pos = title[i]
    word = word.lower()
    if i == 0 or i == len(title)-1:
        print(word)
        title[i] = upper_(word)
    elif pos in {'DT', 'CC', 'IN', 'TO'}:
        title[i] = word
    elif '-' in word:
        a, b = word.split('-', maxsplit=1)
        title[i] = f'{upper_(a)}-{b}'
    else:
        title[i] = upper_(word)
print(*title)
```
