Circumventing Online Paywalls | 3 | 2023-03-09 | piracy

Many paywalls on the Internet can be easily circumvented. There are two types of
paywalls: Hard paywalls which require a paid subscription before any content can
be accessed and soft paywalls which grant the customer a preview first, a
limited amount of content, before demanding payment.

Soft paywalls usually rely on cookies to track how much content you've already
consumed. Simply clear your cookies and the site will have no idea you were ever
there. To do this on Chrome click the three vertically stacked dots on the very
right of the search bar, then click on the item that says "Settings." Click the
"Privacy and security" tab to the left, then click the "Cookies and other site
data" menu item. Then click "See all site data and permissions." Search with the
search bar at the top-right for whatever website you want and click on the trash
icon to the right to delete it.

Hard paywalls like *The Times* or *The Wall Street Journal* are forced to
display their content in full to web crawlers to rank high on Google's search
reuslts, so simply archive the page on an archive site like
[archive.ph](https://archive.ph/); This work because archive sites archive pages
in a similar way Google does.

A more conveninent option may be trying to refresh the page (by pressing the
button directly to the left of the searchbar or pressing Ctrl+R) and before the
page loads you should see that button turns into an X. Click it right before the
page finishes loading. If the page instantly loads before you have a chance to
press the X button, try pressing Ctrl+Shift+R to clear your cache for that page
before reloading—this makes the page load slower. This almost always works, you
just have to time it correctly—it may take a couple of tries. News sites like
The Atlantic, The New York Times, or National Geographic all work with this
technique.

Alternatively you could try installing a browser extension like [uBlock
Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) and using its zapper mode to erase or zap
away the elements blocking your view.

In summary, there are four options to bypass paywalls:

- Clearing your cookies.
- Archiving the site.
- Interrupting refresh.
- Zapping an element with AdBlock.
