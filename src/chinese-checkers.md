Chinese Checkers in Python | 3 | 2023-07-02

I occasionally play Chinese checkers. It is called 跳棋 in Mandarin and translate literally to "jump chess." Essentially the game is similar to the western checkers/draughts but instead of a square board we have a hexagonal one and the aim of the game is to move all your pieces into your opponents home. There is no taking of pieces.
