    <h1 style="text-align: center">Having Fun with an iPad</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center"><i>2022-12-04</i></p>
    <p>I have an iPad Mini 2 that I use to read eBooks. I transfer the books to and from my iPad using the technique I outlined on one of my recent posts: I create a temporary HTTP server on my desktop that broadcasts a <code>index.html</code> file with a list of hyperlinks, then I click on one of them from the iPad to download the book. It took me a ludicrous amount of time to find out that you could mount the iPad just like any other USB. The Arch Linux Wiki has a guide足as it does for everything足on iOS. I followed the Wiki&#039;s instructions:</p><ol><li> I installed <code>libimobiledevice</code> and <code>usbmuxd</code>, both of which I apparently already had.</li>
<li> I ran <code>idevicepair pair</code>. The command exited, printing something like &quot;please trust the device,&quot; then a little bubbly box pops up on the center of my iPad, asking me whether it should trust the device. I clicked &quot;trust.&quot; I ran the pairing command again. It doesn&#039;t print out an error, which I assumed meant the pairing went well.</li>
<li> I mounted it, with <code>ifuse ~/ipad</code>. It worked!</li>
</ol><p>I <code>cd</code>&#039;d into the directory and there these subdirectories stood,</p><pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">ls</span>
Books  DCIM  Downloads  iTunes_Control  PhotoData  Photos  Radio</code></pre><p>Inside the directory <code>DCIM</code> was the subdirectory <code>100APPLE</code> and inside that directory were all of my photos and videos, in JPG and MOV format. Inside the directory <code>Books</code> was a subdirectory <code>Purchases</code> which contained all the books I had on my iPad. This is all merry and exciting but I wanted to use my iPad, in addition as a ebook reader, also as a MP3 player. I wanted to listen to audiobooks or music outside while sunbathing, but I can&#039;t well tug my heavy PC out everytime I did this. There wasn&#039;t an obvious folder to store audio, but I heard that I could jailbreak my device to store audio into Apple Music or something similar.</p><p>Jailbreaking was surprisingly easy, I downloaded Phoenix from <a href="ttps://jailbreaks.app/legacy.html">jailbreaks.app/legacy.html</a> since my iPad is a Mini 2足it runs iOS 9.3.5. I clicked buttons, followed instructions, waited on progress bars, then on my homescreen appeared a shiney new app called Cydia. I searched online for a method of importing music, and a reddit post led me to a jailbreak tweak called mImport. I install that using Cydia, but it didn&#039;t work out. There <em>was</em> a new button in the Apple Music app, that allowed me to choose a audio file from my iPad&#039;s filesystem, but whenever I tried to select a audio file it crashed.</p><p>Jailbreaking the device allowed me to mount with <code>ifuse ~/ipad --root</code>, which gave me access to the <em>entire</em> iPad filesystem, not just a portion of it. I had a fun few minutes exploring the structure and layout of my iPad, but this didn&#039;t lead to any insights on how I could listen to audio on the iPad.</p><p>I did find a tweak that does work though, an Ad blocker by the same author as mImport, so being able to watch YouTube without an Ad every few minutes is great. But I couldn&#039;t use mImport. Then I came up with an idea: Why not put the audio onto any video, then put the video onto the iPad?</p><p>I ran <code>ffmpeg -i audiobook.mp3 -f lavfi -i color=c=0xff00ff:s=640x480:r=30 -shortest out.mov</code> to convert an audiobook I had to a video with a 640 by 480 pure fuchsia background. I tried just copying that video into the <code>DCIM</code> folder of my iPad, where all the videos and photos were stored, but that didn&#039;t work out. The Photo program of the iPad didn&#039;t pick up the video. So, I fiddled around a bit, and found where the photo and video metadata was stored足in a SQLite database in the <code>PhotoData</code> subdirectory.</p><ol><li> I copied the video with <code>cp ~/out.mov ~/ipad/DCIM/100APPLE/IMG_0033.MOV</code>.</li>
<li> I run <code>sqlitebrowser ~/ipad/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite</code>, by choice of tool to edit and browse a SQLite database.</li>
<li> There were a lot of tables, looking around I found <code>ZGENERICASSET</code> that seemed most relevant to what I was doing. The table had a row for each video/photo and a lot of other information associated with that video/photo. I duplicated the row of a pre-existing video, then change only the columns regarding width, height, and filename.</li>
<li> Then I save and exit out of <code>sqlitebrowser</code> and run <code>fusermount -u ~/ipad</code> to unmount the iPad before unplugging the wire connecting it to my desktop.</li>
<li> I check, and lo and behold the video with its audio is present in my photo app, and works!</li>
</ol><p>By the way, I ran <code>select * from ZGENERICASSET order by Z_PK desc limit 1;</code> from the sqlite CLI to get the last row of the table, which looks like this:</p><pre><code>51|23|4|0|0||||||0|0|1|0|0|1920|0|0|1|102|1|3|24|0|0|0|0|1080|51|||9||20480||689797057.443527|||||689797023|2.23333333333333||689797023|689797023.461807|||||||DCIM/100APPLE|IMG_0031.MOV||com.apple.quicktime-movie|CD4267DD-764C-4FF9-A400-4D05A02C29ED||||</code></pre><p>That&#039;s it for this post, I&#039;m planning to change the structure of my website by using React and Next.js or something similar, so this post may not be as polished as the other ones.</p>
